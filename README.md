## Welcome to We Right Code

### Mission

Our mission is to help grow the community by providing thoughtful feedback on PRs for individuals as well as businesses. Our goal is to teach and grow individuals and organizations in their engineering practices without shaming them. Compassion for ourselves and others is our ultimate concern.

### How will you do this?

Our PR review process will focus on lowering cognitive load by way of increasing readability and reducing complexity scores. As part of the review process, we will point out common gotchas as well including leaking information, side affects, overly complex conditionals, and the occasional outright bug. As we solidify our process, we will begin writing publically about how we perform reviews as well as speaking at conferences on the topic.

### Currently iterating on ideas

We are still working through a business plan at this time, so details will be forthcoming. In the interim, we will hand select individuals from the developer community to provide pro-bono reviews on PRs to demononstrate our values and build a local presence.

### Want to see where this goes

While the idea is in its infancy, feel free to follow us @werightcode on Twitter where we'll make most of the announcements. The account was just setup by @baseLogiK, so there isn't much content yet. It may seem sketchy, but we'll address this. You have his word. If you want to take part either in receiving feedback on PRs, please send us a DM. After we build out a minimum code of conduct, we'll start to consider opening the doors for other partners in this venture who are like minded in wanting to mentor with compassion.
